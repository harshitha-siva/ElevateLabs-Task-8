- Helps bypass geo-restrictions and censorship.  
- Reduces tracking and profiling by advertisers or malicious entities.  

## Learning Outcomes  
By following the steps of this project, learners will:  
- Gain hands-on experience with VPN setup and configuration.  
- Understand the importance of IP masking and encryption.  
- Learn how to verify secure connections through practical testing.  

## Usage Scenarios  
VPNs are widely used in:  
- Public Wi-Fi security  
- Remote work connections  
- Accessing restricted content  
- Enhancing digital privacy  

## Conclusion  
This project highlights VPNs as an essential component of cybersecurity. With simple configuration and testing, users can experience how VPNs ensure privacy, protect communication, and create a safer internet experience.
